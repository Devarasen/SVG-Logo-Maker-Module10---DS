## Description

This project will generate a customized svg file for users logo.

Command line tool will be used to generate an svg logo and write it to file. I have utilised npm package manager, node.js, jest testing framework and javascript to create this tool.
I have also used inquirer.js to create a command line interface to ask the users for input.
The logo is generated using svg markup and written to file using the fs module.
The logo is generated using the user input and the svg markup is created using javascript template literals.

Walkthrough video will show instructions on how to create your own svg logo file using this project.
The video will also show the tests being run.
